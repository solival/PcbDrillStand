# PCB Drill Press Stand
This is small neat drill press stand designed for laser printer engines widely sold on ebay/aliexpress.
This project based on (TODO: url) design with next improvements:
- Designed for engine sized L= D= (TODO: Sizes)
- Added 3x 3mm super light LED holders focused on drill working area
- Added PCB with voltage regulator and connector for standard notebook power unit (which is used for drill and light). This can be easily changed on any power source up to 24v (only connector should be changed in this case).

Apart from that no big changes. I print gears with 40% filament and all other parts with 20% filament. Works fine.
